Things left to do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	1)	Properly handle all promotions (made either by the computer or the user).
			
	2)	Implement a GUI using Swing.
	

	
Possible improvements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	1)	PERFORMANCE:
		Change the data types used to represent the valid moves in a position.
		Better use a Vector of Integers rather than a Vector of Arrays of Integers.
		
	2)	Change the findValidMoves function in order to return all the valid moves
		(including castling and en-passant moves).
		
	3)	Improve the AI function by making the computer "cut" some branches of the tree
		when analysing variations.
		
	4) 	Make further improvements on the AI:
	
		eg. a)	The computer could "remember" some of its "findings" and use them 
				when analysing its next move.
		
		eg. b)	The computer could analyse some variations during the opponents turn.
		
		eg. c)	Insert the element of "time" in the computer's AI. 
				Make it play the best move he has analysed so far if there is no more time left.
				
	5)	Better error handling in some cases (eg. the game should not end abruptly when
	 	a wrong-formatted move is entered by the user).
