Notes:
~~~~~~

  - This version (v2.0) contains one additional feature, which is ab-search. 
    It also contains a way to measure how quicker the computation of variations is, when using ab-search, compared to using minmax-search.
 	Note that in previous versions we were using the method name "deep_search" instead of the method name "minmax_search".
