Chess
===========

* Contains all the basic functionality of a chess game.
* The chess engine is a gready one: it tries to get ahead in material!

This project's java classes can be used in order to:

1. Evaluate a position, which must be hard-coded as "input" (Test_Positions_X.java classes).
2. Play a chess game against the engine, by using a console-based, simple GUI (PlayGame.java class).
